## Hello there! I'm Natalia ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year student of Computer Science at the University of GdaÅ„sk and a member of Work In Progress scientific club. My primary interest is web development.

During my free time I enjoy drawing, drinking coffee and petting cats :smile_cat:

:rocket: I'm currently learning **Java** and **Go**.

:telescope: I'm working on **TaskMaster**!

If you're interested in my other projects, check out my GitLab profile [@n-niewiadowska](https://gitlab.com/n-niewiadowska)! It mostly contains beginner's projects.
