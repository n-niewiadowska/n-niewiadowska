## Hello there! I'm Natalia 👋

I'm a second-year student of Computer Science at the University of Gdańsk and a member of Work In Progress scientific club. My primary interest is web development.

During my free time I enjoy drawing, drinking coffee and petting cats :smile_cat:

:rocket: I'm currently learning **Java** and **Go**.

:telescope: I'm working on **TaskMaster**!
