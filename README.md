<p align="center">My name is Natalia and I'm a third-year Computer Science student with a dash of professional experience as a Software Engineer. :computer: <i>"There's always a room for more knowledge"</i> is my personal motto - even if you know your stuff inside and out, there's always another layer to uncover! That's why it is my active quest to practice and expand my skillset.</p>

<p align="center">I'm web and software developer, though my heart aspires to be a game creator. Recently, I became interested in 3D graphics. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games 🎮, travelling ✈️ and petting cats :cat2:.</p>
