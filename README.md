<p align="center">My name is Natalia and I'm a third-year Computer Science student and a Software Engineer. :computer: <i>"There's always a room for more knowledge"</i> is my personal motto - learning is the key to empowerment! That's why it is my active goal to practice and expand my skillset.</p>

<p align="center">I'm web and software developer, though my heart aspires to be a game creator. Recently, I became interested in 3D graphics. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games 🎮, travelling ✈️ and petting cats :cat2:.</p>
