## Hello there! I'm Natalia ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year student of Computer Science at the University of GdaÅ„sk and a member of Work In Progress scientific club. My primary interest is web development, but I like the challenges other fields have as well.

During my free time I enjoy drawing, drinking coffee and petting cats :smile_cat:

:rocket: I'm currently learning **Java** and **machine learning**.

:telescope: I'm working on **TaskMaster**!

If you're interested in my other, more beginner-level projects, check out my GitLab profile **[@n-niewiadowska](https://gitlab.com/n-niewiadowska)**!
